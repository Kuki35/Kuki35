  <h1 align="justify">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm YiÄŸit Can</h1>
<h3 align="justify">I was selected as a 2021-2022 scholarship student to the Game and Application Academy, which is a partnership of Google, T3 Enterprise Center and Entrepreneurship Foundation. On this occasion, I learned the Unity program and C# language. At the same time, I took Google Project Management Certificate Program trainings on Google Coursera. In these trainings, I learned the duties and responsibilities of a project manager and project manager assistant, and agile (scrum) project management with all its details. The gaming industry excites me in many ways. While I have seen myself in the gaming chair as an amateur and professional in many game genres until now, I decided to advance my career in this direction, especially after I had the experience of producing games at the Game and Application Academy. I am currently developing games of my own in Unity. I am also interested in project writing, tracking and research. In my spare time, I write projects for the European ESC31 program and follow the projects in this field. Now, I am writing the game I made at the end of a bootcamp as a European Union project. The game I have made is an educational game for children aged 6-12, aiming to raise environmental awareness.</h3>
